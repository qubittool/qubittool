JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs are a popular choice for API security and authentication in modern web applications.

## The Anatomy of a JWT

A JWT is composed of three parts, separated by dots (`.`):

1.  **Header**: Metadata about the token.
2.  **Payload**: The claims or data.
3.  **Signature**: For verifying the token's integrity.

A typical JWT looks like this: `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`.

### 1. Header

The header specifies the token type (`JWT`) and the signing algorithm used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

This JSON is **Base64Url encoded** to form the first part of the JWT.

### 2. Payload

The payload contains the **claims**, which are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims:

-   **Registered Claims**: Predefined claims like `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), `sub` (subject), and `aud` (audience). These are recommended for interoperability.
-   **Public Claims**: Custom claims defined by developers, which should be registered in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry to avoid collisions.
-   **Private Claims**: Custom claims created for specific use cases between parties that have agreed on their meaning.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true,
  "iat": 1516239022
}
```

The payload is also **Base64Url encoded** to form the second part of the JWT.

### 3. Signature

The signature is created by combining the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret key, and the algorithm specified in the header.

```javascript
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  your_secret_key
)
```

The signature ensures that the token has not been tampered with and, in the case of a private key signature, verifies the sender's identity.

## The JWT Authentication Flow

1.  **Login**: The user provides their credentials (e.g., username and password).
2.  **Token Issuance**: The server verifies the credentials and, if valid, generates a JWT and sends it back to the client.
3.  **Token Storage**: The client stores the JWT, typically in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
4.  **Authenticated Requests**: For subsequent requests to protected routes, the client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header using the Bearer schema:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <token>
    ```

5.  **Token Verification**: The server validates the JWT signature and checks the claims (e.g., expiration). If valid, the server processes the request.

## Security Best Practices for JWTs

-   **Always Use HTTPS**: To prevent token interception through man-in-the-middle attacks.
-   **Choose the Right Algorithm**: Use strong algorithms like RS256 over weaker ones. Avoid the `none` algorithm entirely.
-   **Keep Secrets Secure**: Your signing keys must be kept confidential and rotated regularly.
-   **Set Token Expiration**: Always set an expiration time (`exp` claim) for tokens to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.
-   **Validate All Claims**: Properly validate all claims, including `iss` and `aud`, to ensure the token is intended for your application.

## JWT vs. Sessions: Which to Choose?

| Feature      | JWT (Stateless)                                  | Traditional Sessions (Stateful)                  |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **State**    | Server stores no session data.                   | Server stores session data in memory or a database. |
| **Scalability** | Excellent for distributed and microservices architectures. | Can be challenging to scale across multiple servers. |
| **Performance** | Can be larger than session IDs, increasing request size. | Smaller overhead per request.                    |
| **Security** | Vulnerable if not implemented correctly (e.g., token theft). | Prone to session fixation and hijacking attacks.   |

## Advanced JWT Concepts

-   **JWS (JSON Web Signature)**: The standard for signed tokens, which is what most people mean when they refer to JWTs.
-   **JWE (JSON Web Encryption)**: Provides confidentiality by encrypting the payload, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read it.
-   **JWK (JSON Web Key)**: A standard for representing cryptographic keys as a JSON object.

## Conclusion

JWTs offer a powerful and flexible solution for authentication and information exchange in modern applications. By understanding their structure, flow, and security considerations, you can build secure, scalable, and stateless systems.
